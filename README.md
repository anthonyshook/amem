# amem

The goal of Adaptable Mixed Effects Models (amem) is to provide a framework for using custom models (linear or non-linear) within a mixed-effects model structure. This allows us to build models that utilize an arbitrary method for generating predictions for fixed effects, which are then adjusted by calculating the linear form of random-effects.
